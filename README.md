# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Network
## Overview
Customer churn prediction is a critical task for businesses seeking to retain customers. This project utilizes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to forecast customer churn based on various features and historical data. The ANN model, inspired by the human brain's neural network structure, is adept at learning and generalizing complex patterns. By leveraging this advanced machine learning technique, we aim to predict customer churn, enabling businesses to take proactive measures to retain their customer base.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare your dataset and ensure it's in a suitable format for training.
Follow the steps outlined in the Training section to train the ANN model on your dataset.
Use the trained model as described in the Evaluation section for customer churn prediction.
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about customer interactions, purchase history, and other relevant features. It is preprocessed to remove any missing values and encoded for suitability in training the ANN model.

## Model Architecture
The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) used in this project consists of multiple layers, including input, hidden, and output layers. The architecture utilizes appropriate activation functions, such as ReLU and Sigmoid, to optimize learning and prediction.

## Training
To train the ANN model:

## Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and normalize features.
Compile the model specifying appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.
Train the model using the preprocessed dataset and validate its performance.
Evaluation
To evaluate the trained model:

Prepare new data for prediction, following the same preprocessing steps as during training.
Use the trained model to predict customer churn based on the new data.
Results
The model achieved significant accuracy in predicting customer churn, with a detailed analysis of metrics and visualizations provided in the Results directory.
